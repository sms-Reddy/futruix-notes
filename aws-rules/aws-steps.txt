when we are creating an instance in e2c then aws provide default storage and default network

    storage in ebs (elastic block store) and network in vpc (virtual private cloud)
    key pair and security group also



configure storage --> 30gb 


key-pair should used for multiple instances 

key-pairs are free

    download pem file 

    connect in rdm not in putty

Ec2 instance families

-------------------------------

t1 t2 r3 t4 


AMI (amazon machine image )
----------------
 it is type of template with some default dependencies 



Types of IP's
---------------------------

Ips means Internet Protocol

every machine should one ip address 

3 types 
------------
public 
private 
elastic / static



here every machine has public and private ip 

private ip not changed and public ip is changed 

and stattic public ip we can crete by using elastic ip (paid) - commercial 

storage
----------------------------

elastic block store (ebs)

when we create an instance by default we get root value 

root value is 8gb for linux 
for windows 30gb 

when we terminate instance then root volume will be terminated 
should ot delete the root volume direcly

we can attach and detach attditional volumes like harddisk or pendrive 

if we terminate ec2 additionl volume is not deleted 

if we add multiple instances but only one after one 

we can store upto 16tb data in additionl volume 

it is based on zone specific 

5 types of ebs
------------------------

general purpose ssd
provisioned iops
throgout optimized 
cold hdd
magnetic


for provisioned iops (i02) volumes can add multiple instances at a time ... 



Mounting 
--------------------------

1. lsblk  -- to check the volumes 
2. by defaultly xvdf shown 
3. creat a dirctory
4.sudo mount /dev/xvdf newDirectory    --- cd to directory 
5 df -h   --- check the mounts
6. cd newDirectory 
7.create some file and 



list of disk names 

old -- xvda
new -- nvme0n1







Snapshots
---------------
    backup of the volume 
    volume to snapshot or vice versa for create

    volumes or zone specific

    snapshots are regional spcific 

    snapshots are stored in s3 

    by defaulty it is private and we convert into public
