mobaxterm software
----------------------------

go to session ->  ssh ->  pulic-ip and user default ec2-user

advanced settings use private key upload then linux machine opens

when we are creating an instance in e2c then aws provide default storage and default network

    storage in ebs (elastic block store) and network in vpc (virtual private cloud)
    key pair and security group also



configure storage --> 30gb 


key-pair should used for multiple instances 

key-pairs are free 



windows machine connect
------------------------------------------

    download pem file 

    connect in rdm not in putty

Ec2 instance families

-------------------------------

t1 t2 r3 t4 


AMI (amazon machine image )
----------------
 it is type of template with some default dependencies 



Types of IP's
---------------------------

Ips means Internet Protocol

every machine should one ip address 

3 types 
------------
public 
private 
elastic / static



here every machine has public and private ip 

private ip not changed and public ip is changed 

and stattic public ip we can crete by using elastic ip (paid) - commercial 

storage
----------------------------

elastic block store (ebs)

when we create an instance by default we get root value 

root value is 8gb for linux 
for windows 30gb 

when we terminate instance then root volume will be terminated 
should ot delete the root volume direcly

we can attach and detach attditional volumes like harddisk or pendrive 

if we terminate ec2 additionl volume is not deleted 

if we add multiple instances but only one after one 

we can store upto 16tb data in additionl volume 

it is based on zone specific 

5 types of ebs
------------------------

general purpose ssd
provisioned iops
throgout optimized 
cold hdd
magnetic


for provisioned iops (i02) volumes can add multiple instances at a time ... 



Mounting 
--------------------------

1. lsblk  -- to check the volumes 
2. by defaultly xvdf shown 
3. creat a dirctory
4.sudo mount /dev/xvdf newDirectory    --- cd to directory 
5 df -h   --- check the mounts
6. cd newDirectory 
7.create some file and 



list of disk names 

old -- xvda
new -- nvme0n1







Snapshots
---------------
    backup of the volume 
    volume to snapshot or vice versa for create

    volumes or zone specific

    snapshots are regional spcific 

    snapshots are stored in s3 

    by defaulty it is private and we convert into public 

    how to copy one instance data to another instance data 

    life cycle of create snapshot 
    ----------------------------------

        it may be used for when to auto create a snapshot for backup 

        when we create ec2 then mandatory to create ebs 

    


how to install webserver and deploy static website
--------------------------------------------------------
    sudo yum update -y 

    sudo yum httpd  -- install

    sudo systemctl start httpd -- start 

    access ec2-vm public ip in browser 

        note : we need to enable to security group in 80 

    cd /var/www/html to open html page
    sudo vi index.html page 





UserData in Ec2
--------------------------

    userdata is used to execute the script when ec2 isntance launched first time 

    we can say userdata is a default script when ec2 is launched 

    note : when we stop and start then userdata is not execute 

    sudo su
    yum update -y 
    yum install httpd -y
    cd var/www/html 
    echo  "wewrwe some data  " > index.html
    systemstl start httpd 










Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
---------------------------------------------

    load balancers are used to distribute the work load to multiple servers 

    the process of running our application in multiple servers is called Load Balancing 

    to implement load balancing we will use load balancer

    it will distribute the requests in round robin fashion 

    4 types of loadbalancers
    ---------------------------
        1. application Load Balancers
        2. network
        3. gateway 
        4. classic 

    
    to implement load balancer for http and https we go for application Load Balancers

    by using application we can implement path based routing 


    Setup application LB
    ----------------------

        create 3 instance creations 

        create target group with abouve 3 instances 

        create application Lb using target group

        access the application LB using DNS 


        tcp used for network and it will be superfast 

        gateway when third parties we can use 


        application is in 2 ways
        -------------------------------

            monolith and microservices
            --------------------------------------

                monilith application is developed in one project

            microservices
            -----------------

                microservices are load balancers with routing added in listners rules 

Auto Scaling
------------------------
    rpm increases then go for scale up
    rpm decrease then go for scale down


    advantages
    ----------------------
    if any instance is unheakth then it will terminate and add new insatnce -- fault tolernace
    availability 
    cost management

    autoscaling create we want launch templates
    1. steps to create

    1.launch template --> auto scaling group in min and max and desired quantity 
        scaling policy (rpm,cpu utilization)
    2. connect to load balancer
    3. 


how to connect ec2 without pem file 
----------------------------------------------

    stop instance 
    deattach root volume 
    create another instance 
    attach root volume to new istance 
    copy pem key to root to attach 
    and stop instance 
    deattch 
    attach to instance by sunf xvda means root volume
